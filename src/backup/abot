							One spring afternoon in March of 2009, we watched the sun set at
							Longmont's Vance Brand Airport. Chad had finished a flight lesson
							a little earlier and he was sharing his adventure with me. While
							we talked, our hunger grew as did our curiosity why there wasn't
							any food services at the airport... ready, Set, GO or as pilots
							say,
						</p>
						<p>CLEAR!</p>
						<p>
							Flight Deck Grill was launched two months later in May with a
							small street cart. We were anxious to find out if the need for
							food and beverage existed at our airport. The answer was not only
							yes, but it was YES. We learned much, heard great stories and met
							a lot of new friends . As we were getting ready to close up for
							the season, the question asked by all, "Are you coming back in
							May?". Our response was yes, however, we knew we needed to go
							mastermind our comeback plan. Fun season and growth to follow.
						</p>
						<p>
							Over the winter we researched and built a custom mobile grill,
							aka, our rigstaurant, Tinker. 2010, Season 2, our sales doubled,
							but that was easy with the small sales we had in our first year.
							This was our year to learn how to operate our rig and play in the
							event arena.
						</p>
						<p>
							2011, Season 3, better and smarter and knowing how to have more
							fun. Jammed packed with new events, invites back to those events
							from the previous year, AND expanded our business to include
							Catering. We have many loyal customers and our set of friends
							keeps growing. We love new faces coming into visit us and
							appreciating what the airport has to offer. The last week of our
							season in October we made our last payment on the business.
							Wonderful feeling and confirmation that we are doing it right.
						</p>
						<p>
							It's hard to believe Season 14 starts on May 4, 2022. Our
							re-openings always promise a fantastic turnout with a wonderful
							warm welcome. What's next, brick & mortar? 2020 could be an
							exciting year of change for Flight Deck Grill…. so stay tuned.{' '}
						</p>
						<p>
							Have fun when you visit. We encourage you to try something
							different each time and share your favorites with friends. We'd
							love to hear your ideas or feedback.{' '}
						</p>
						<p>Sooooooo…..our motto, when the fun ends, we're going home. </p>
						<p>Here's to the fun never ending! </p>
